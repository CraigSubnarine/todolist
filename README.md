# Project

### Description
Create a web application where a user can create a list of things that they need to do.

### Functional Requirements:
A user should be able to add an item, an item is a string describing what the person has to do. A user should be able to mark an item as completed A user should be able to remove an item from the list

### Non-functional Requirements:
The application should be colour themed The theme should be changeable by the click of a button Use cookies as storage

### Notes:
Use of react for frontend will be awarded points as this is the framework that will be used (react is first choice, if user is proficient with another frontend framework e.g. vue, angular, that would be considered as well) Syntax ES6 will be awarded Proficiency in functional programming paradigm will be rewarded Proficiency in software engineering will be greatly awarded points as well (e.g. Components having a shared state for theming)


# My Notes
 
 I set out to complete the objectives of the project, and while doing so I gained more knowledge and a better understanding of React.

While considering the possibilities of the application I have found that Redux would have been a more applicable choice if the application needed to be scaled. For the purposes of this application handling state with basic react was sufficient.

I have also come to appreciate cookies and their importance in small web applications. Mainly the ease of use as well as the ability to set an expiration date to them. 
I was able to store the todo-list data as well and the theme setting so the user would be able to refresh or re-open the application and find it the way they left it. While doing so the problem with "setState" not updating the state of the application on time as found and resolved using a callback function.

This is my 1st time working with Material-UI and it has shown me that I need more practice with UI elements. I fount it was a bit easier to use compared to the Bootstrap 

An about page was made just to use Routes in React. 

In the testing branch, I tried to use a restAPI from https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/ but ran into problems due to CORS protocols.
